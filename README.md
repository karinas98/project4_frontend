Consume my API with a separate front-end, built with React
Implement thoughtful user wireframes
Complete & Launch a final & functioning product

## Project Overview
For this project, I wanted to find an idea that I can build on and easily increase its complexity. I’ve always had some interest towards how to build an e-commerce site and this project is a starting point for that. My idea around the theme was to give a voice and space to upcoming artists and designers to show their work and potentially sell a few pieces to those that value quality handmade products. This is why the application is an exclusive site that you need to register and create a profile for. Once that is done, you are able to create a new ad, write product reviews, see your favourite’s list and add items to the cart. You also have a personal profile where all your created products can be found and where you can delete and update your listing.

## Planning & Wireframing
What I wanted to achieve with this wireframe is to create a full prototype to understand the user experience and all functionalities. By doing so, I could then take it page by page and really grasp what needs to happen.
